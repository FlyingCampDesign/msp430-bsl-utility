RELEASE NOTES
=============

KNOWN ISSUES
------------

- The default install of python/Tk/Tcl on OSX Snow Leopard has some bugs
  which cause severe errors when trying to run this application.  The
  progress bar does not update and trying to quit using cmd+q causes a
  segfault.  Upgrading to python >= 2.6.4 and Tcl/Tk >= 8.5 fixes these
  issues.  
- The 'Toggle TEST on TX' option is currently disabled because it relies 
  on serial.win32file (in bsl.py) provided by pySerial releases OLDER than 2.5.
  pySerial releases 2.5 and later on windows no longer rely on pywin32
  and therefore do not provide serial.win32file.  This feature will remain
  disabled until the dependency on serial.win32file is removed from bsl.py.
